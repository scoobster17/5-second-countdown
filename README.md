# 5 Second Countdown

Re-creation of simple game app I once played on my old iPhone, built in JavaScript for the hell of it.

## Installation

There is a slight bit of setup required for this due to a dependency that needs loading.

### Pre-requisites:

- Have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (recommended installation: [n - node version manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n))
    - Have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed (included with newer node releases)

### Steps to install

Run the following command in your terminal / command line to install the ```joose-utils``` dependency:

```
npm install
```

## Disclaimer

I claim no ownership over the game itself, I have simply tried to reproduce an existing game for the practice of writing JavaScript to achieve a goal; in this case a simple game.
